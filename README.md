### Project 1 -  Optimization in Matrix Multiplication (Grade: 17/20)

Application of two different optimization techniques in the Matrix Multipliation algorithm. Firstly, we employed algorithms that minimize the number of cache misses and used different programming lanaguges to assess performance improvements. Secondly, we parallelized the best version found in the first part in two different ways andevaluated and discussed the results.

### Project 2 - Server for multiplaying Guessing TicTacToe Game (Grade: 17/20)

Implementation of a server for a Guessing TicTacToe game. Server manager is able to choose the size of a game and the game mode ( Simple or by Ranking). Multiple players can then log in and play together. Fault tolerance mechanism to ensure the game continues even after players are disvonnected from server.
